//In order to set up tests using mock annotations
    //1.Add the following dependencies to your build file:
//    <dependency>
//  <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
//  <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
//  <version>2.23.0</version>
//  <scope>test</scope>
//</dependency>
//

    //Annotate the fields that you want to mock using the @Mock annotation:
    //@Mock
    //private SomeClass someObject;
    //In your tests, you can use the mocks to simulate the behavior of the objects they represent,
    // and then verify that the code being tested behaves as expected.
